# Monogame Tetris Tutorial
A Monogame based tutorial series, goal is to have a fully working Tetris game. Note that this is purely a **learning exercise**. This project is not affiliated with _The Tetris Company_. I chose this game to provide a challenging but fun game to learn more about!

## Introduction
This tutorial (or "how did he do this?") aims to reproduce the game. The ruleset used based of [The Tetris Guideline](https://tetris.wiki/Tetris_Guideline). Since there are a ton of tutorials out there focussing on 2D spritebased games, this game will be visualised with 3D objects. Fear not, it is not as hard as it looks!
