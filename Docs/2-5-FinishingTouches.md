# Finishing Touches
We almost have a complete game of Tetris! Only a few things left to do...

## Score
Playing Tetris can be a zen-like experience, however it can still be a competitive game! Various game modes exist where the goal is to score as many points as possible.

## Increase the difficulty
At the moment, nothing is happening when lines are completed. Time to ramp up the challenge!

## Game Over Man!
Once the top of the grid is reached... nothing happens. That can't be right!
